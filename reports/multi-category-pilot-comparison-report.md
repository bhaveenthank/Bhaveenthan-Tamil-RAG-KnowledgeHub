## Finding

The shared contract works for the existing Saivam verse/commentary seed and the bounded
Tamil-Tamil dictionary entry. Grammar, Sangam, prose, and encyclopedia pilots still
require source inspection and local fixtures before ingestion. This is the principal risk
and the intended control point.
